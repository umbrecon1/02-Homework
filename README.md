# Code Refactoring

These are things that were done to make it better!

-Deleted unnecessary classes but getting rid of divs and utilizing semantic elements such as Header, Aside, Article, Nav, and Sections.

-Reordered CSS to line up with HTML

-Fit everything in each section to their corresponding article or aside.
